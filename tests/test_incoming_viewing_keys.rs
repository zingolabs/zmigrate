//! # Test Suite: Incoming Viewing Key (IVK) Preservation Tests
//!
//! This test suite verifies that Incoming Viewing Keys are properly preserved during
//! wallet migration. Unlike Full Viewing Keys (FVKs), IVKs are typically stored directly
//! in ZCash wallets and are critical for detecting incoming transactions.
//!
//! The tests verify:
//! 1. IVKs are properly extracted from source wallets
//! 2. IVKs are correctly associated with the right addresses after migration
//! 3. The exact IVK values match before and after migration
//! 4. Address without IVKs are handled correctly (no errors/crashes)
//! 5. Only shielded addresses (not transparent) can have IVKs
