//! # Test Suite: Unified Address Migration Tests
//!
//! This test suite verifies that unified addresses are properly migrated:
//! 1. Unified addresses are properly extracted and preserved during migration
//! 2. Diversifier indices are correctly preserved
//! 3. Receiver type information is maintained
//! 4. Unified addresses are correctly assigned to accounts
//!
//! Each test focuses on a specific aspect of unified address migration.
