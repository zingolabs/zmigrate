//! # Test Suite: Address Migration Tests
//!
//! This test suite verifies that all aspects of address migration work correctly:
//! 1. All address types (transparent, sapling, unified) are properly extracted and preserved
//! 2. Address metadata (names, purposes, HD paths, keys) is correctly migrated
//! 3. Addresses are assigned to the correct accounts
//!
//! Each test focuses on a specific aspect of address migration, with helpers to
//! extract addresses and their metadata for comparison.
