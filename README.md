# zmigrate: ZCash Migration Framework

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Blockchain Commons, Wolf McNally, and the Zcash Community_

## Introduction

The zmigrate crate is the start of a framework for the universal translation of ZCash wallet formats.

Currently it parses the `zcashd` and `zingo` formats into memory, and outputs a the debug representation of the parsed data.

## Prerequisites

You will need a `zcashd` or `zingo` wallet.dat file to test with. Some `wallet.dat` files may be found in the `zcash-wallet-formats` repo [here](https://github.com/zingolabs/zcash-wallet-formats/tree/master/zcashd/dat_files). They have been copied into this repo at `test/fixtures/`.

Because `zcashd` uses BerkelyDB, you will need to have the `db_dump` tool installed on your system. On macOS, `db-dump` is part of the `berkeley-db` package, which can be installed with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install berkeley-db
```

The `zingo` format requires no additional tools.

## Getting Started

After cloning this repo, you can run the following command to parse a wallet.dat file and write the parsed data to a file. You do need to specify as the first argument whether you are parsing a `zcash` or `zingo` wallet.dat file.

```sh
cargo run -- [zcash|zingo] path/to/wallet.dat > wallet-dump.txt
```

For `zcash`, the tool will first print out a summary of the keys in the wallet.

For both formats, it will then dump the contents of the wallet to the file `wallet-dump.txt` in Rust debug format. If it encounters an error, it will print a list of the nested error contexts and exit.

It is convenient to review the Rust debug output in VS code, as the editor allows collapsing of indented sections. The Shift key can be used to do this recursively.

If local installation is desired (not recommended at this time), you can install the tool with:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

## Status

### What's working

- Parses all `zcashd` and `zingo` wallet files in the `zcash-wallet-formats` repo as of 2025-02-24.
- The parsing framework is designed to be extensible to other wallet formats, and uses a single `parse!` macro to flexibly parse fields of various structures using type inference wherever possible, but also allows the specification of types where necessary.
- The parsing framework handles deeply-nested structures, and is designed to give useful context when errors occur.
- The `zcashd` directory contains specializations of the parsing framework for the way that `zcashd` structures are serialized in `wallet.dat` files. These may or may not ultimately be shared with other wallet formats.
- The `zingo` directory only contains specializations of the highest-level structures, relyin on `zingolib` and its dependencies to parse the lower-level structures.

### What's not working

- No decryption of encrypted fields in the `zcash` wallet format is performed yet. This will be necessary to fully parse the wallet into in-memory structures that can be written to a wallet interchange format or other wallet formats.
- Not all documented keys in the `zcashd` wallet format have implementations. A survey of which keys are currently being parsed is available in the [src/zcashd/KEYS.md](src/zcashd/KEYS.md) file.

### What's needed

- The main effort now is to find common abstractions between the `zcashd` and `zingo` formats, and to refactor the `zmigrate` framework to extract these commonalities from the `zcashd` and `zingo` in-memory structures.
- More testing with a wider variety of `wallet.dat` files.
- PRs that either correct errors, or add new parsing capabilities, such as decryption of encrypted structures.
- The `zcash-wallet-formats` repo needs PRs to add more `wallet.dat` files to test with.
- Wallets of other formats listed in the `zcash-wallet-formats` repo need to be added to the parsing framework.

### The Future

The goal is to create a universal wallet migration framework that can translate between any wallet formats, and that can be used to create wallet interchange formats that can be used to migrate wallets between different wallet apps.

- The core `zmigrate` crate, which vends the command line tool.
- The `zewif` crate contains the universal parsing framework and in-memory abstractions. This crate also directly supports the reading and writing of the `zewif` interchange format, which is based on Gordian Envelope.
- Several *front-end back-end libraries* that support the parsing of wallet formats into `zewif` abstractions, and translating those abstractions to their format.
