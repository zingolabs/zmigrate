# Best Practices for Importing & Exporting Wallet Data

The ZeWIF format is a specification for the import and export of Zcash wallet data, enabling interoperability among walls, and creating freedom for users. However, the ZeWIF format also requires work from individual developers who want to interop their data, whether they are using the ZeWIF format or not.

```

As the above diagram shows, the zmigrate Rust crate lies at the center of the ZeWIF system. It creates in-memory representations of data from a variety of inputs and can  output that abstracted data in a numbers of forms. Obviously, it can accept input from ZeWIF and it can output to ZeWIF. However, that's just part of the process. Individual developers can also choose to use creat front ends that interface their own wallet data to zmigrate and back ends that export the data from zmigrate to their own wallet.

The following best practices offer suggestions for those front-end and back-end wallet developers, to ensure that their data remains not just maximally interoperable, but also maximally accessible, both now and in the far future.

## The Core Format

***[Export:] Use Defined CBOR Tags.*** If there is a ZeWIF-defined CBOR tag for a piece of data that is being migrated, that CBOR tag should be used, even if it requires converting the data type as part of the migration.

* _Example:_ [an example of a CBOR and something from a wallet that should be stored in that format, especially if the wallet stores it with a different data type]

***[Export:] Break Apart Composite Data.*** If a single datum in a wallet contains several individual keys and values, they should be separated out before migrating them, even if they're related.

* _Example:_ `zcashd`'s CKeyMetaData contains a seed fingerprint (uint256), a creation date (UNIX timestamp), and an HD/ZIP-32 Keypath (string). Those datums should each be individually stored when migrated.

***[Import:] Destroy ZeWIF Files after Importing.*** After importing a ZeWIF file, you should give users the option to destroy it, as it will usually contain sensitive information. An alternative is to ***Re-Encrypt for Storage*** as discussed below.

## Key Migration

***[All:] Use Account Abstractions.*** Some Zcash keys are based on system data, while others are HD keys derived from a seed. However, users of most wallets instead see keys grouped into accounts, which may contain related HD keys, unrelated system-randomness keys, or multiples of any of these. Since accounts represent a crucial usability tool for users to understand what is in their account and what it does, they should be preserved both through export and import, even if they represent an abstraction without any "real" meaning for how the keys relate.

* _Example:_ [This was certainly our recommendation based on the data survey and meeting #1. I assume it's how things are being done in ZeWIF? If so, we can provide examples. If not, we can dump this.]

***[Export:] Store Existing Assets As They Are, Usually.*** In the vast majority of cases, the migration process should happen without making any changes on the blockchain. This is not the time to do other clean-up, except in a few important cases. You want to preserve the data being imported as it is, because it was theoretically in a known, working state.

* _Example:_ A user has lots of Zcash dust that can't be used effectively. Nonetheless, the keys controlling that dust should be converted over. The new wallet can decide if it wants to do anything with the issue.

***[Export:] Sweep for Bugs In Asset Control If Possible.*** If your wallet did something out of spec with the larger Zcash community and it affects the control of assets, this is important to resolve before exporting your data, because future wallets will not know about the variance from the specification and it could cause lost of funds. Spec variance is mostly likely to be a variance in how keys are derived from a seed or a master key, but there might be other issues. In these cases, move funds off of the out-of-spec keys or seeds (or whatever) before migrating the wallet file.

* _Example:_ `zecwallet-cli 1.0` incorrectly derived HD wallet keys after the first key, affecting both `t` and `z` addresses. Funds on addresses after the first should be moved prior to the migration of a `zecwallet-cli 1.o` wallet as future wallets won't know about these incorrectly derived keys, and thus will not be able to access the funds without knowing specifically how to derive them.

***[Export:] Sweep Sprout-Keyed Assets If Desired.*** Since Sprout keys [are being considered for full deprecation](https://zips.z.cash/zip-2003), this might be a good time to move all Sprout-keyed funds to Sapling keys, prior to migration of the wallet data. However, this should only be done with user agreement, and it should be considered optional. (If ZIP-2003 is approved for deployment, then best practices will quickly become to sweep all Sprout funds before they become unspendable.)

* _Example:_ Version 2.0.5-2 of `zcashd` has a Sprout-to-Sapling migration tool, whose usage is fully described in [ZIP-308](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0308).

***[Export:] Ensure that Data Files Represent a Post-Sweep State.*** Even if sweep of funds is done due to specification variances or Sprout migration, ensure that it occurs before the wallet file is export and migrated.

* _Example:_ This is just a logistical reminder! You don't want to start your migration process, export your file, sweep funds, and then migrate a file that doesn't have the new sweep addresses!

## Data Classes & Data Types

***[Export:] Store Data Not Included in the Spec.*** The ZeWIF project recognizes three classes of data: important data used in multiple wallets (class I); important data used by one or few wallets (class II); and unimportant data (class III). It only specifically covers class I data, which should include all data required for asset recovery. Class II data remains important, but because it's wallet-specific, it falls on individual wallet developers to decide which of their data is class II and store this data when migrating to ZeWIF. This is done by storing class II data in [attachments](attachments.md).

* _Example:_ [an example of something that didn't make it into the ZeWIF spec, but which we still suggest storing.]

***[Export:] Store the Entire Data Set.*** After migrating all the discrete data elements into ZeWIF, the complete wallet file should be stored as a separate [attachment](attachments.md), to ensure that nothing is lost, not even class III data. The `vendor` should be defined with a reverse of the main domain name for the wallet publisher and the `conformsTo` should be set to the best specification for the wallet or if that does not exist the central marketing page for the wallet. [[This should probably be part of the spec, and it may need to be rewritten based on what's there.]]

* _Example:_ The `wallet.dat` file from `zcashd` is copied into the ZeWIF file as a blob and identified as the last step of the migraiton.

### Wallet-Specific Data

***[Export:] Drop Wallet-Specific Configuration.*** Wallet-specific configuration is an example of class III data, as it's no longer needed when the data is removed from the wallet. It can be dropped as a result.

* _Example:_ Zecwallet stores a spam threshold and a memo download option in its `WalletOptions`. These can be ignored when migrating a Zcash wallet.

***[All:] Store the Wallet Version.*** Despite being wallet-specific information, the wallet name and wallet version should be always be added to ZeWIF as metadata, _supplementing_ (not replacing) any wallet name and version already connected to the file. This creates a provenance chain for the ZeWIF file, identifying all wallets where the data has been used and allowing future users to debug issues that might have originated with a specific wallet. [[This should probably be in the spec too, and this best practice should be edited when it's there.]] To ensure this provenance chain, wallets importing ZeWIF data should also store information on any previous wallets, so that it can be re-exported as part of that chain.

* _Example:_ A ZeWIF file originated with `zcashd 6.1.0`. When data is exported from `zcashd`, the ZeWIF file is marked appropriately. That data is later imported into the Zingo! wallet, which correctly preserves the fact that the data was previously held by `zcashd`. When the data is later reexported from Zingo!, it's marked with `zingo` and `v1.12.1`. Both versions will be seen (and imported) by the next wallet the user chooses to use.

### Calculated & Downloaded Data

***[Export:] Store All Transactions Information.*** Different wallets store different information regarding transactions. Some of it is recoverable from the blockchain, some of it is not. Nonetheless, all transaction information should be stored, whether it's recoverable or not. Storing irrecoverable information is obviously a requirement. Storing recoverable information keeps the new wallet from having to look up information on the blockchain (which is a privacy concern, as noted below). Storing everything held by a wallet ensures that you don't make a mistake and accidently omit something because you thought it was recoverable and it was not.

* _Example:_ `zcashd` mostly stores nonrecoverable information regarding transactions, such redeem scripts, but it also stores recipient addresses, which are theoretically recoverable with an outgoing viewing key. The "theoretical" in that statement is exactly why _all_ transaction data should be stored.

***[Import:] Do Not Look Up Unknown Transaction Information.*** When you are importing transaction data, generally do not look up missing data, even if it would usually be stored for transactions in your wallet. This is because looking up transaction data can be a privacy concern: the Zcash node that you contact will know what transactions you are asking about, and therefore that they're related to your IP address. (There are alternatives, including downloading the entire blockchain to fill in missing information and using privacy-focused communication methods such as Tor.)

* _Example:_ `zcashd` does not store most of the recoverable transaction information, such as block heights, fees, prices, times, etc. This data should not be individually looked up by an importing wallet to fill in the data.

***[Export:] Store Almost All Witness Trees.*** Witness Trees are definitely recoverable, but they're a pain to calculate, so they should be stored as part of a ZeWIF file.

* _Example:_ Zingo! maintains Witness Trees in TxMap.WitnessTrees. This information should be preserved.
  
***[Import:] Drop Incorrect Witness Trees.*** Best practice is to recheck witness trees as they're being imported and to dump them if they're incorrect, so as to not incorporate corrupt data into the new wallet.

## Attachments

***[Export:] Store Undefined Data with Attachments.*** As noted above in ***Store Data Not Included in the Spec*** all data that is considered important should be exported. If data is not in the spec, it should be instead stored as an [attachment](attachments.md).

* _Example:_ [an example of something that didn't make it into the ZeWIF spec, but which we still suggest storing.][which just might be a repeat of the above]

***[Export:] Simplify Data in Attachments.*** Do your best to simplify any data you put into an attachment. At a minimum you should ***Break Apart Composite Data*** as described above, but you should also do your best to regularize it and otherwise make it easily accessible to other developers or users who may be accessing the data in the future.

* _Example:_ [an example of something that didn't make it into the ZeWIF spec that could benefit from normalization._

***[Export:] Document Attachments Online.*** It is recommended that  a `conformsTo` assertion be included with each attachment. This is even more highly recommended as a best practice when storing class II data into attachments. Ideally, the `conformsTo` should be a web page that specifies exactly how all attachments data is stored: what it is and how it's encoded. By storing this data in a web page you can ensure that it's accessible far into the future: even if your web page is gone, it can be retrieved through a service such as archive.org.

***[Export:] Date or Version Your ZeWIF `conformsTo`.*** Specifications can change over time. It's therefore best to supplement any `conformsTo` content with a date or version. A date can simply be added to the wrapped attachment, preferably using a `date` assertion and a [ISO-8601 derived W3C data format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).  Alternatively, the URLs used in `conformsTo` can be version specific, with a new URL for each new version. This ensures that if a URL is retrieved in the future with archive.org, it's either automatically correct (if URLs are versioned) or will be correct if the correct date is chosen.

* _Example:_ ZSampleWallet uses a `conformsTo` URL for all of its attachments of `https://www.zsamplewallet/spec/v1.0/`. When they add a new attachment, they replace their `conformsTo` URLs with `https://www.zsamplewallet/spec/v1.1/`.

***[Export:] Document Attachments in ZeWIF with other Metadata.*** Many attachments will just be a blob of wrapped data, tagged with `vendor` and (optionally) `conformsTo` assertions. However other assertions can be added to the wrapped data as metadata, such as the `date` assertion suggested above. Plain-text names, descriptions, and even instructions on how to unarchive the data are also possible. Whenever possible, information that could help a future importer to read and understand the data should be included.

* _Example:_ [something not in the spec, with an `importInstruction` or something that explains how to use it.]

## Encryption

***[Export:] Decrypt All Data.*** All data that was encrypted in the original wallet file must be decrypted before being placed ZeWIF. Wallet importers will not know how to decrypt your data, and so if it remains encrypted it will be lost.

* _Example:_ Zecwallet private keys are encrypted using the secretbox Rust crate, using a doublesha256 of the user's password and a random nonce and a combination of Salsa20 and Poly1305. Even if the password and nonce were known, an importing wallet may not know the procedure to use them to decrypt, which is why decryption must occur prior to the migration of the data file.

***[All:] Securely Transmit Data.*** Because ZeWIF has sensitive, decrypted data, it must be transmitted securely. Encrypted means such as SSH, Tor, and HTTPS are the best choices, but an [Animated QR](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/) is also fairly secure. If the transmission mechanism is not secure (such as Bluetooth or NFC transmission), ensure that the data is encrypted before transmission, as discussed below.

* _Example:_ ZSampleWallet offers an Animated QR of an `ur:envelope` as a ZeWIF export function. If another wallet has been programmed to read in that data, the transmission should be fairly secure (absent unlikely in-person surveilance).

***[All:] Re-Encrypt for Storage.*** If ZeWIF data is going to be stored, and if it contains sensitive data (which will almost always be the case), it should be reencrypted. This is not currently possible using the zmigrate crate, but ZeWIF files are [Gordian Envelope-compliant](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/), which means that the [bc-envelope-cli-rust app](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust) may be used to manipulate any ZeWIF file output by zmigrate, including encrypting it.

* _Example:_ The Envelope CLI may be installed using `cargo install bc-envelope-cli`. The ZeWIF file can then be encrypted using [symmetric encryption](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust/blob/master/docs/BasicExamples.md#example-4-symmetric-encryption) (in which case the key must be carefully preserved) or [SSKR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust/blob/master/docs/SSKRExample.md) (in which case the envelopes with shares should be separated, as the data can be encrypted if a threshold of the envelopes are together).

## Elision & Compression

***[All:] Elide Thoughtfully.*** The standard use case for a ZeWIF file involves using it to migrate data between two wallets. However, ZeWIF may also be used for other purposes, such as transmitting information on the state of a wallet to an accountant. In these cases, sensitive information that is not required by the recipient (such as keys and seeds) should be elided prior to the transmission of the data. This is not currently a feature of zmigrate, but it can be accomplished by piping the output ZeWIF file through the [bc-envelope-cli-rust app](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust). 

* _Example:_ Envelope-CLI docs explain [how to redact specific information from a Gordian Envelope](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust/blob/master/docs/VCElisionExample.md).
  
## Reports

***[All:] Report All Failures.*** Any failures to export data should be reported to the user. This might include data purposefully excluded from the export process. Any failures to important data must be reported to the user.

***[Import:] Flag Asset Failures in Red.*** If a failure to import data results in keys or seeds not being imported, this must be clearly reported with red, bold, or otherwise highlighted warnings, as it could result in a loss of assets.

* _Example:_ ZTestWallet doesn't know what to do with keys not associated with seeds, so it does not import them. This is flagged for the user with a bold warning so that they can either sweep their funds prior to moving to the new wallet or else choose a different wallet that better meets their needs. The user decides to sweep, and so when they return with a new post-sweep ZeWIF file, it no longer reports errors. This allows them to begin using the new wallet with confidence.
